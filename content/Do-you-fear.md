What is this place!? What..? I am so scared. I don't know what to do, who I am? where I'm going? Where are you going?? It's here! This place. I want to see. So desperately want to see. What are these sounds. They come out of the walls, the bounds. I cant see them. I cant feel them. Yet they overwhelm these... feeble... senses... Yes. Indeed. Welcome to Apocolyspe. Here, everyone pretends not to see; the magma, lavafalls, cindering tree. Rest Assured, you will walk on burning coal and *shhhhh* for but a drop. You will thirst and bleed cry and plead. Screaming into an empty oasis. And it will be beautiful.
